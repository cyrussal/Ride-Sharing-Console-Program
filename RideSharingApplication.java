This program will allow users to upload posts to a social media platform to ask for a ride to a location.
At the beginning, the user is given a choice to find, create or see all available posts.
If looking for a particular post, the user is able to filter by eight different criteria to see if they can find a best match for their needs.
If creating a post, the user can enter detailed information about their ride and post it for other users to see.
After the user finds or creates a post, the user is given the option start the process all over again or simply end the program.
Any posts or responses to posts created in this program will be saved while the program is still running.
This allows users to search posts they have just made or commented on.
